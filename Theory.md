**What is python?**
--> python was developed by Guido van rossum
--> python is a high level popular programming language.
--> python is a object oriented programming language.
--> interpreted , dynamically-typed , simple , readable & versatile programming language.
--> python  supports automatic gardage collection .

**applications of python**
--> web developer
--> software development
--> Data analysis
--> Machine learning and artificial intelligence
--> Game Development and So on....

**why to Learn python?**
--> python has a simple syntax.
--> Easy to learn and Use
--> Software Development,Web Development & Machine Learning.
--> Shorter code 
--> so many project can be built

**Time and Space Complexity**
--> The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time take by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.
--> Space complexity is the amount of memory an algorithm requries to solve a problem, as a function of the input's characteristics.

**keywords**
--> keywords are predefined,reserved words used in python programming.
--> we cannot use a keyword as a variable name,function name or any other identifier.
--> ex:and,as, assert,break,class,continue,def,elif,else,except,False,for,from,global,if,import,in,is,lambda,noniocal,none,not,or,raise,pass,return,True,try,with,while,yield


**identifiers**
identifiers are the name given to variables, classes,methods,etc.
**Rules for Naming identifiers in Python**
--> Start with a letter(a-z,A-Z),digits(0-9), or underscore(_).
--> Cannot start with a Digit
--> No special characters(!,@,$,etc.)
--> Case-sensitive(e.g:age,Age and AGE)
--> Avoid using keywords

**Variables**
In programming, a variables is a container(storage area) to hold data.
**Rules for Naming Variables in Python**
--> Start with a letter(a-z,A-Z),digits(0-9), or underscore(_).
--> Cannot start with a Digit
--> No special characters(!,@,$,etc.)
--> Case-sensitive(e.g:age,Age and AGE)
--> Avoid using keywords.

**constants**
--> A Constant is a special type of variable whose value cannot be changed.

 **Data types**
 --> integer
 --> string
 --> float
 --> boolean
 --> none

**comments in python**
-->the inclusion of short descriptions along with the code to increase its readability
**types of comments**
-->**single-line comments**
 -->start with a hash symbol(#)
 -->anything after the hash symbol on the same line is a comment
 -->**multiline comment**
 -->also known as block comments
 -->enclosed by triple double quotes(""") 
 -->used to provide detailed explanations,document code,or temporarily disable a block of code


 **operators**
 the operator is a symbol that perform a certain operation between operands
 **types of operators**
 1.arithmetic operators(+,-,*,/,%,**)
 2.relation/comparison operators(==,!=,<,>,<=,>=)
 3.assignment operators(=,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=**=)
 4.logical operators(not,and,or)
