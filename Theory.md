**What is python?**
--> python is a high level popular programming language.
--> python is a object oriented programming language.
--> interpreted , dynamically-typed , simple , readable & versatile programming language.
--> python  supports automatic gardage collection .

**applications of python**
--> web developer
--> software development
--> Data analysis
--> Machine learning and artificial intelligence
--> Game Development and So on....

**why to Learn python?**
--> python has a simple syntax.
--> Easy to learn and Use
--> Software Development,Web Development & Machine Learning.
--> Shorter code 
--> so many project can be built

**Time and Space Complexity**
--> The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time take by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.
--> Space complexity is the amount of memory an algorithm requries to solve a problem, as a function of the input's characteristics.

**keywords**
--> keywords are predefined,reserved words used in python programming.
--> we cannot use a keyword as a variable name,function name or any other identifier.

**identifiers**
identifiers are the name given to variables, classes,methods,etc.
**Rules for Naming identifiers in Python**
--> Start with a letter(a-z,A-Z),digits(0-9), or underscore(_).
--> Cannot start with a Digit
--> No special characters(!,@,$,etc.)
--> Case-sensitive(e.g:age,Age and AGE)
--> Avoid using keywords

**Variables**
In programming, a variables is a container(storage area) to hold data.
**Rules for Naming Variables in Python**
--> Start with a letter(a-z,A-Z),digits(0-9), or underscore(_).
--> Cannot start with a Digit
--> No special characters(!,@,$,etc.)
--> Case-sensitive(e.g:age,Age and AGE)
--> Avoid using keywords.

**constants**
--> A Constant is a special type of variable whose value cannot be changed.

**literals**
-->Literals are representations of fixed values in a program.
They can be numbers, characters,or strings,etc.
**Types of Literals**
1.Numeric Literals
2.String Literals
3.Boolean Literals
4.None Literals
5.Bytes and Bytearray Literals
6.Raw string Literals
7.Numeric separator
8.Collection literals:
-list,tuples,set,dictionary
